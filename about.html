                <div class="about-member">
                    <p>Tyler is currently majoring in Computer Information Systems. They have a passion for technology 
                        and enjoy solving complex problems, which is why they work at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) 
                        as part of the IT help desk, specializing in system administrative work. 
                        Every day presents new challenges, and they love finding efficient solutions to help people with 
                        their technical needs. <p>Outside of their professional and academic pursuits, they enjoy playing the piano, 
                        which allows them to express creativity and relax. They are also an avid language learner — currently 
                        focusing on Chinese (Mandarin) —
                        because they believe understanding different languages opens doors to new cultures and perspectives.

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We believe in fostering a dynamic 
                and engaging learning environment that goes beyond the classroom. "Trivial Trivia" is 
                designed to test and expand students' knowledge of our rich campus history, distinguished 
                faculty, and the vibrant community that makes UofM-Flint unique. Through this 
                interactive platform, our goal is to inspire curiosity, deepen connections to the 
                university, and promote a sense of pride among students.By aligning with UofM's 
                commitment to excellence in teaching and learning, we aim to:
                Engage students in meaningful partnerships with faculty, enhancing both academic 
                growth and collaboration.
                Develop mastery and confidence in various disciplines, preparing students for 
                a future of meaningful and productive work.
                Support research, creativity, and innovation through fun and challenging questions that
                 stimulate critical thinking.
                Encourage students to connect their knowledge with real-world applications, promoting 
                service and engagement both within the university and in broader society.
                Uphold the values of academic freedom, diversity, equality, and justice, creating an 
                inclusive space for all participants to celebrate the UofM legacy.
                Through "Trivial Trivia," we invite the UofM-Flint community to celebrate its past, 
                engage in the present, and prepare for a future shaped by knowledge, collaboration, and creativity.</p>
